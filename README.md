# Medical Cost Forecasting
#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict the medical charges based on patient information using Multiple Linear Regression.

### Methods & Technologies Used
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python
* Pandas, Numpy
* etc. 

## Project Description
Data was thoroughly analyzed to find patterns and correlations with the target variable being the charges. 


## Notebooks
* MedicalCost_Dev_eda -- Exploratory data analysis, data visualizations, cleaning, preprocessing
* MedicalCost_Dev_modelling -- Model performance (Multiple linear regression, polynomical regression, lasso regression, backward elimination), model validation, model comparison
